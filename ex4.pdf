1. Quicksort is a divide and conquer algorithm. It works by picking a pivot element from an array and then dividing 
the remaining elements into two smaller arrays (sub-arrays) based on whether each element in greater or less than the
pivot element. After the creation of the two sub arrays, the arrays are then sorted in a recursive manner.
The worst-case scenario for the quicksort method occurs when the pivot element is chosen as the smallest or largest
element in the array. In this case, the algorithm will make n-1 recursive calls due to the unbalanced partitions, and each 
sub-array will be of size n-1. Consequently there is a total of n-1 levels of recursion, and each sub-array will be of
size n-1. Thus, this leads to a time complexity of O(n^2)

We can also represent it in this way:
Let X(k) be the worst-case time complexity of quicksort for an array of size k.

Then,

X(k) = X(k-1)+X(0)+O(k) where X(k-1) is the time taken to divide the array into smaller sub-arrays
                              X(0) is the time taken to divide the array with zero elements and,
                              O(k) is the time taken for the dividing/partioning step

By solving this, it is determined that the quicksort time complexity is O(k^2)
